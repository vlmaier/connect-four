<h2>Buy a car</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You're a programmer and you want to buy a car. There are several restrictions on the path of buying a car:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val mercedes = ...
val red = ...
val enoughMoney = ...

val buyCar = enoughMoney &amp;&amp; (!mercedes || red)</code></pre>
<p>So, select the desired combinations of restrictions when <code class="language-kotlin">buyCar</code> is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>.</p>
